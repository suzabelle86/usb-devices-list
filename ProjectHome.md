This project is my small side program that I created at my company. I know that inside it looks like hack and slash and this is because I didn't have much time to check/resolve/test all external DLL/PInvoke. I post it here because it took me a lot (!) of time to find appropriate functions, ictl calls, etc.. in internet and transfer them to C#

> The project will list all connected USB devices (including connected to HUBS) and list them into file.

> This project created as example and posted here to help others in they way to program USB devices in C#
